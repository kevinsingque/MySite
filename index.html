      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I have more than 5 years of experience in a BPO-Call center industry where I capped it off as a team leader.
        I've encountered both highs and lows from that path of career which led me realized that I have the skills in
        managing people and
        in collaborating with different minds.
        Since I wanted to change tracks, specifically to being a web developer, I am currently at the stage of learning things on how to code. (Student Level)
        Why I changed career? I want to challenge myself so I can explore more on what I can do just how I verge into learning other musical instruments too.
        One thing I learned from my past experiences? "Never stop exploring and keep learning".</p>
